# McWebby Debug Log

WordPress MU (must use) plugin to support error logging. 

- enables PHP logging
- configures the log file location
- includes a function mcw_log for printing debug information to the log

# Configuration

Currently you must edit the plugin file to set the error log file location. 
We plan a revision that will enable configuration of the log file via WordPress 
administrative interface and/or wp-config.php.
